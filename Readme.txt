Hi All,

While using the back-end test automation project, I preferred the Java language. This a Maven project. I prepared it using Junit & mashape.unirest library.

While using the UI test automation project, I still preferred the Java language. This a Maven project. I created it using gauge framework. At the same time, Dockerfile and docker.compose.yaml are in the project.

Before start test automation, I used a test management tool called Qase. First of all, I prepared the scenarios through this tool. You can reach it from the UI_and_Back-end_Manual_Scenarios file.

After completing the scenarios, I created a regression suite using the Qase tool and reported the tests here. You can find the results in the Regression_Suite_Results file.

I will look forward to your feedback :)

Best Regards,
Sinem Merve Yilmaz
